# Configuration

Dashing is set up to do all of its mapping through Convention over Configuration. However, all of the 
conventions can be overridden through the api.

> There are (a few) times when you have to explicitly configure entities. For example, having multiple foreign key properties of the same type.

The following sections detail how to perform the various functions:

* [Configuration Basics](configuration-basics) - how to add entities to your domain and some common modifications
* [Conventions](configuration-conventions) - what conventions are there and how to override
* [Indexes](Indexes) - how to add Indexes
